The 4-Queen Problem is a combinatorial puzzle to place 4 queens on a 4x4 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This repository provides a backtracking-based solution to find all valid configurations efficiently.

Step-by-Step Solution for the 4-Queen Problem Step 1: Start with the first queen

1-Place the first queen in the first row (row 0).
2-Try the first column (column 0).
3-The board is empty, so no conflicts. The first queen is placed! Step 2: Place the second queen
4-Move to the second row (row 1).
5-Check column 0: Not safe (vertical attack by the first queen).
6-Check column 1: Not safe (diagonal attack by the first queen).
7-Check column 2: Safe! Place the second queen here. Step 3: Place the third queen
8-Move to the third row (row 2).
9-Check column 0: Not safe (diagonal attack by the second queen).
10-Check column 1: Not safe (diagonal attack by the first queen).
11-Check column 2:
12-Not safe (vertical attack by the second queen).
13-Check column 3: Safe! Place the third queen here. Step 4: Place the fourth queen
14-Move to the fourth row (row 3).
15-Check column 0: Not safe (diagonal attack).
16-Check column 1: Not safe (diagonal attack).
17-Check column 2: Not safe (vertical attack).
18-Check column 3: Not safe (vertical attack).
19-No safe spot for the fourth queen. Time to backtrack! Step 5: Backtracking
20-Remove the third queen from column 3.
21-Try moving the third queen to another column: No other safe spots in row 2.
22-Backtrack further: Remove the second queen from column 2. Move it to column 3 (safe now). Step 6: Adjust and Retry
23-Place the third queen in row 2: Check column 0: Safe! Place it here.
24-Place the fourth queen in row 3: Check column 2: Safe! Place it here. The Final Board After all the steps and adjustments, the final positions of the queens are:
25-Row 0, Column 0
26-Row 1, Column 3
27-Row 2, Column 1
28-Row 3, Column 2 The puzzle is solved! All queens are safely placed without attacking each other.
